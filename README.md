# Smart Home System using C/C++

In this project, I developed a Smart Home System in C/C++ using an object-oriented approach to manage various smart devices, such as Lights, Sensors, Speakers, and Thermostats. The system allows users to interact with these devices through a command-line interface, providing features like turning devices on/off, adjusting settings, scheduling, and tracking energy usage. Users can sort devices, add new ones, and access full device features. I also implemented a file persistence feature to load and save the device data between sessions. The system includes customizable device names and a quick view of each deviceâ€™s status for easy management.
